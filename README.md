# Bamazon

## Introduction
- I created an Amazon-like storefront app, called Bamazon, using MySQL, the MySQL NPM Package and Inquirer Package.
- This app takes in orders from customers.
- The app first displays a list of all of the available products, their costs, and current stock. 



- The app asks the following things from the user.
- What is the ID of the product that works best for you?



- It must be ran in the command line.
- Type in node bamazoncustomer.js to start the app.
- These are the npm packages I used and are needed to run the app

npm install 
npm install mysql
npm install inquirer
