# Bamazon

## Introduction
- I created an Amazon-like storefront app, called Bamazon, using MySQL, the MySQL NPM Package and Inquirer Package.
- This app takes in orders from customers.
- The app first displays a list of all of the available products, their costs, and current stock. 



- The app asks the following things from the user.
- What is the ID of the product that works best for you?
-Once the customer has placed the order, the application check if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

-If not, the app should log a phrase like Insufficient quantity!, and then prevent the order from going through.

-However, if your store does have enough of the product, the app fulfill the customer's order.
-Once the update goes through, show the customer the total cost of their purchase.-
